# ml_projects
Machine Learning projects to understand core concepts
## Summary
### 1.) Transfer learning using Keras
Using Inception V3 architecture to deploy a transfer learning model based on ImageNet dataset. New data are from Kaggle's Cat and Dog dataset.
### 2.) Image Dimension Reduction using OpenCV
Using OpenCV built-in methods to reduce a RGB Image to Grayscale Image and Binary Image (3 channels to 1 channel reduction).
### 3.) Evaluation Metrics from Confusion Matrix
Class to find accuracy, specitivity, precision, recall and F1-score on a generic NxN confusion matrix and evaluate the model per class and globally.
